# XOX Game

A clean and minimal Tic-Tac-Toe (XOX) implementation with simple logic
and a straightforward interface.

## Features

-   Two-player local gameplay
-   Automatic win and draw detection
-   Lightweight, dependency-free codebase
-   Clear, maintainable structure

## How It Works

Players alternate placing **X** and **O** on a 3×3 grid.\
After each move, the game checks all rows, columns, and diagonals for a
win.\
If the board fills with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
